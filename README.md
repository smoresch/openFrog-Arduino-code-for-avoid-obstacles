FROG v2.0

An Arduino sketch for move a robot avoid obstacles using distance sensor HC-SR04 and HUB-ee wheels.

The name from is from the sensor HC-SR04, the "head" of the robot.. it locks like a frog =P

The purpose of this project is to improve the ability of this arduino sketch to avoid obstacles. Anyone can use this code. 
Contact me at moreschisimone@gmail.com for info about hardware. Now i have one HC-SR04 sensor and two HUB-ee wheels.

Any suggestion is appreciated to improve the robot. Hardware and software, too.

Frog is a low cost robot.
